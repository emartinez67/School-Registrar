# School-Registrar
Software Enginnering Capstone Team Project

The School Registrar is an application that will allow students of a University to register for classes and stay up to date with their grades and academic standing. Students will be able to design their schedules so that they can choose the best times, Professors, and classes available to them. The Students will also be able to easily track their grades in the classes they are enrolled in.

There will be three categories of users, Students, Faculty, and Administrators. Students and Faculty will be provided with emails and accounts that they use to access the system. Professors will post updates to the Students' grades. Administrators will add the courses that will be provided by the University to the School Registrar allowing Students to register for classes.

The world assumptions are that the Students and Faculty can access the system. Students would prefer to take classes at times that are convenient and with professors they prefer. In-person classes have a maximum number of Students that can be enrolled at one time. Students cannot be enrolled in two classes that take place at the same time. Students need to be kept up to date with their grades. The requirements are Students should not be allowed to sign up for classes that result in a conflicting schedule or allow them to sign up for classes they don’t have the prerequisites for.
    
The specifications and interface needs are that we prevent students from registering in classes they can’t take. The registration process is easy to use. And that only the Student and Professors can see sensitive information, for example grades. The programs we will be using are, Java, JavaFx, Scenebuilder, and SQL. We will also be using a database to store the school data. 

We will be meeting virtually Tuesdays at 5:00 PM and on Saturdays at 1:00 PM.
